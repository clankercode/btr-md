# Mermaid contrast defaults

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Status:** implemented

## Problem

Mermaid diagrams rendered with unreadable node labels — light text on a
light fill (dark themes) or dark on dark (light themes). Example: nodes
showed as solid lavender boxes with no visible text.

## Root cause

Mermaid's `base` theme uses `primaryColor` as the node **fill** and
`primaryTextColor` as the node **label** colour. All 17 bundled theme
manifests set both `mermaid_primary` and `mermaid_primary_text` to the same
palette value (`fg`). The backend mapped them straight through to
`primaryColor`/`primaryTextColor`, so every node's label was the same colour
as its fill — invisible. WCAG validation never caught it because its contrast
pairs don't include the mermaid fill/text pair.

## Fix

Good defaults derived from the core palette, still overridable per theme.

- **Backend** (`crates/pmd-app/src/cmd/theme.rs`): derive the full mermaid
  variable set from core palette tokens, each overridable by an explicit
  `mermaid_*` palette key:
  - node fill (`primaryColor`/`mainBkg`) ← `mermaid_primary` else `bg_elevated`
  - node label (`primaryTextColor`, and `secondary/tertiaryTextColor`,
    `textColor`, `nodeTextColor`, `titleColor`, `labelColor`, `noteTextColor`)
    ← `mermaid_primary_text` else `fg`
  - node border (`primaryBorderColor`/`nodeBorder`, secondary/tertiary borders)
    ← `mermaid_primary_border` else `border`
  - lines (`lineColor`) ← `mermaid_line` else `fg_muted` (then `border`)
  - secondary fill ← `mermaid_secondary` else `bg_elevated` mixed 50% toward `bg`
  - tertiary fill ← `mermaid_tertiary` else `bg_elevated` mixed 82% toward `bg`
    (the `bg_elevated`↔`bg` axis stays clear of `fg`, so the derived fills are
    guaranteed to clear AA against `fg` text — mixing toward `accent`/`fg`
    instead can fall below AA on low-contrast themes)
  - the same principle is applied across every diagram type whose labels sit
    on a deterministic fill: notes, sequence actors/label-boxes (accent moves
    to the border, not the fill), subgraph clusters, gantt task/section bars
    (status moves to borders, overwriting mermaid's literal `lightgrey`/`red`
    defaults), and quadrant-chart regions. The parse-error graphic keeps its
    fixed red fill with a fixed near-black text so it is readable on every
    theme. Edge-label background unchanged.

  Fill comes from a surface token (on the `bg_elevated`↔`bg` axis, which is
  always clear of `fg`) and text from `fg`, so they always contrast.
  Auto-generated multi-hue palettes (pie slices, git branches, colour scales)
  are left to mermaid; their seeds (`primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary`) are now
  theme-appropriate surfaces.

- **Schema** (`crates/pmd-core/src/theme/schema.rs`): the five basic
  `mermaid_*` keys move from *required* to *optional* (plus new optional
  `mermaid_primary_border`). A theme can now define **zero** mermaid keys and
  still get readable diagrams.

- **Manifests** (all 17 `themes/*/manifest.toml`): all five basic
  `mermaid_*` lines are removed so the derived defaults govern. The retained
  `mermaid_secondary`/`_tertiary` values were light "brand" colours, not
  fills — pairing them with `fg` text reproduced the invisible-label bug on
  secondary/tertiary nodes — so they are stripped too and the fills are
  derived as surface tints that contrast with `fg`. Bundled themes now define
  zero mermaid keys; the override path remains for custom themes.

## Allowing custom styling

The override path is preserved: any `mermaid_*` palette key set by a theme
wins over the derived default. So a theme author who wants bespoke diagram
colours simply sets the keys; everyone else gets sensible theme-matched
defaults for free.

## Regression guard

`crates/pmd-app/tests/cmd_theme.rs::every_bundled_theme_has_readable_mermaid_nodes`
asserts that, for every bundled theme, each label-bearing fill/text pair
clears WCAG AA (4.5:1): the three node tiers, notes, sequence actor and
label-box, the error graphic, gantt task/active/done/crit/section bars,
subgraph clusters, and the four quadrant-chart regions.
